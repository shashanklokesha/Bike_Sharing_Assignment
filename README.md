## General Information
- **Background**  
    The Bike Sharing Case Study analyzes data from BoomBikes, a U.S.-based bike-sharing provider, to assess demand patterns and forecast future bike usage. The study aims to help BoomBikes understand demand dynamics and optimize its business strategies for the post-pandemic market.

- **Business Problem**  
    - Identifying the key factors influencing bike-sharing demand.
    - Predicting future demand to help BoomBikes plan and adjust operations.
    - Enhancing business strategies to meet customer expectations and stand out in a competitive market.
  
- **Dataset**  
    The analysis uses a dataset with information on daily bike rentals. The dataset includes variables such as weather conditions, season, holidays, working hours, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which influence bike-sharing demand. The dataset is used to explore patterns in bike usage and predict demand based on these variables.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Version 3.x)**: Programming and data analysis.
- **Pandas (Version 1.4.0)**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy (Version 1.22.0)**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib (Version 3.5.0) and Seaborn (Version 0.11.2)**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running the analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development.

## Conclusions
- **Weather Conditions**: The demand for bike-sharing is highly influenced by weather conditions, with higher usage during pleasant weather.
- **Seasonal Demand**: The demand for bikes peaks during spring and summer months, while it declines in winter.
- **Temperature and Humidity**: Higher temperatures generally increase bike rentals, while high humidity can reduce demand.
- **Working Hours**: Bike usage is higher during working hours, suggesting that commuting plays a major role in demand.
- **Yearly Trends**: Demand for bike-sharing services is increasing year over year, as indicated by the 'yr' variable, making it a valuable predictor.
